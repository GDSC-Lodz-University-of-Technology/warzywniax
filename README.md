# ðŸ¥’ WARZYWNIAX

## Motivation

The goal of the project is to create an application that helps farmers and smaller local sellers to
sell their products such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, preserves, etc.

With such an application, smaller sellers could reach their customers directly and would not be
burdened with the intermediary markup that cuts into their profits. In addition, the application
would significantly facilitate the sale of products for very small farmers who may not have the
means to advertise and reach a wider audience.

This application could potentially also solve the problem of wasting products that have expired by
allowing sellers to mark offers for such products and sell them at a much lower price or even offer
free pick-up.

Users who use this application will also have the opportunity to eat healthier and support local
businesses. Each user will also be able to contribute to reducing their carbon footprint by better
managing food waste.
